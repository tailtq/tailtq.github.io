Hi, I'm Tai Le, a software engineer who loves learning new things. In 2017, I quit my university and started the software development journey at Softech Aptech. Fortunately, I got my first job at NeoLab as a back-end engineer in 2018, one year after I quit.

I also participated in a Hackathon competition with my friends in late 2019. We didn't achieve any great results but we had a very great time working together.

At the end of 2020, I graduated from Aptech with a distinction certificate. On top of that, I got a high position in an Aptech's competition and my face was in one of the famous electronic newspapers in Vietnam (you can read the article [here](https://dantri.com.vn/giao-duc-huong-nghiep/hoc-vien-viet-nam-gianh-giai-tai-cuoc-thi-cong-nghe-cua-aptech-toan-cau-20200514134857752.htm)).

After working for 2 years, I challenged myself with AI, specifically in Computer Vision, and became an AI engineer (but still stick with software though). Because of that, I began learning at the University of People in 2021 to have a college degree. I expect to graduate at the beginning of 2023 thanks to the support of my friends, who I got to know during my studying time.

Currently, I am working at [ParadoxAI](https://www.paradox.ai/), a US-based software company to develop a virtual assistant to speed up the hiring process of large corporations around the world.

In my free time, I often read random things about back-end to increase my understanding in the field, I also spend time finding a girlfriend too >.<. Besides, I am interested in developing my personal projects to help me automate boring tasks, you can check my [GitHub account](https://github.com/tailtq?tab=repositories) out to see them.
