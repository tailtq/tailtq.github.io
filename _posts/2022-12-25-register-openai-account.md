ChatGPT is a viral AI technology that everyone is talking about, not only researchers but also people without understanding AI domain as well. It is a powerful application built on top of OpenAI GPT-3.5 that can help human working on multiple complicated tasks. For example, it can optimize SEO content, write code like a pro, consult in multiple problems, etc. Even though some tasks are quite complicated for ChatGPT to handle, it has proved the future of AI is coming.

In this article, I will guide you to register an OpenAI account in restricted areas, then we will experiment OpenAI ChatGPT to test its capabilities.


## 1. Register OpenAI accounts

According to [OpenAI documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/supported-countries), there are only 156 countries that are allowed to register for new accounts in OpenAI. If not, you cannot register, look at the picture below for more information.

As a person whose country is not in the list, I also want to experience the hype of ChatGPT too, are there anything I can do to get through this situation? Fortunately yes, let's figure it out.


### a. Install VPN on Chrome

I used [VeePN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-vpn-for-chrome-vpn-p/majdfhpaihoncoakbjgbdhglocklcgno) and it worked really well, but feel free to choose other tools. After installing, choose a country that is in the list.


### b. Clear registration's cache

Please open Developer Tools to clear all cache in case you already pushed the register button. Then follow the steps below:

### c. Verify phone numbers

After using email, OpenAI requires to verify the phone number as well, I used [SMSPool][https://www.smspool.net/] to handle this case. Basically, SMSPool will provide a phone number on the dashboard to input in the form, then it will show the code sent from OpenAI on the dashboard.

In the beginning, you need to pay $1 for using this service, it uses Stripe for payment so feel to input your credit card information there. You can input your credit card. Please follow the images below:

1. Click the deposit link, input the amount and payment method, then click the deposit button.

Eventually, click the **Quick Order** link and choose **OpenAI** service and **Select cheapest** option. Subsequently, it will display multiple countries' flag, you can click into one of these (I chose US)
