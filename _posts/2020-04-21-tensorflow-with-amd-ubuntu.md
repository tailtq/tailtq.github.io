After I received my graphic card (Radeon RX 570 Series) from my cousin. So I started using Tensorflow and found out my training process was also extremely slow, like when training with my MacOS.

After reading some articles and being through many tedious days, I successfully set up my Tensorflow with Docker based on it. So in this article, I would like to share with you how to set it up in the most convenient way.

No more further instruction, letâ€™s get started!



## 1. Install ROCm on Ubuntu

1. Run the following code to ensure that your system is up to date:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install libnuma-dev
sudo reboot
```

2. Add the ROCm apt repository:
```bash
wget -q -O - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
```

3. Install the ROCm meta-package:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rocm-dkms
```

4. Set permissions:
```bash
groups
sudo usermod -a -G video $LOGNAME
echo 'ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/adduser.conf
echo 'EXTRA_GROUPS=video' | sudo tee -a /etc/adduser.conf
```

5. Restart the system

6. Verify ROCm installation is successful:
```bash
/opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo
/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64/clinfo
```

![/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64/clinfo](/assets/img/2020-04-21/command-2.png)

__Note:__ To run the ROCm programs more efficiently, add the ROCm binaries in your PATH.
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm/bin:/opt/rocm/profiler/bin:/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/rocm.sh
```



## 2. Install Docker

There are a ton of instruction in the Internet, but I recommend you to follow the steps which were written in this [article](https://do.co/2zcd8NI).



## 3. Setup Tensorflow with ROCm

1. Pull Tensorflow image (make sure your Docker is running):
```bash
sudo docker pull rocm/tensorflow:latest
```

2. Run container with Tensorflow image:
```bash
docker run -i -t \
    --name=tensorflow \
    --network=host \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --group-add video \
    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    --workdir=/docker \
    -v $HOME/your-working-directory:/docker rocm/tensorflow:latest /bin/bash
```

__Note:__ If you restart your computer, you could exec to your container using these 2 following commands:
```bash
sudo docker container start tensorflow # container name
sudo docker exec -it tensorflow /bin/bash
```

3. Run Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook --allow-root
```

4. Create a new notebook:

## 4. Run Tensorflow

In this tutorial, we will use Python to test our ROCm. (For someone who doens't know Python, I encourage you to take some crash courses on the Internet).

We will test our ROCm with a basic neural network and MNIST dataset:

```python
# Install required packages
!pip install cv2 numpy matplotlib
```

```python
# Load libraries
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, MaxPooling2D, Conv2D, Flatten

import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
```

```python
# Load dataset by Keras mnist
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```

```python
# Categorize target
y_cat_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_cat_test = to_categorical(y_test)
```

```python
# Standardize features
X_train = X_train / 255
X_test = X_test / 255
X_train = X_train.reshape(len(X_train), 28, 28, 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(len(X_test), 28, 28, 1)
```

```python
# Define model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(5,5), input_shape=(28,28,1), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(5,5), input_shape=(28,28,1), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
             optimizer='rmsprop',
             metrics=['accuracy'])
```

```python
model.summary()
```

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_cat_train, epochs=3)
```

![Training result](/assets/img/2020-04-21/image-4.png)

```python
model.evaluate(X_test, y_cat_test)
```

```python
# Save model
model.save('model.h5')
```

## 5. Summary

After going through various steps, we have our running Tensorflow in AMD GPU. It is worth for spending our time on doing this setup instead of wasting a ton of hours training without ROCm.

However, I also have some reviews after taking ROCm for a while:
- Darknet framework not yet supported (very famous for YOLO, a real-time object recognition model)
- It is not working with PyTorch (there are some bugs that can't be fixed)

So, with weak cards, I think using Google Colab will be much more effective (11 GB GPU + 16 GB RAM). But if you have a strong AMD card, you should set up and then evaluate yourself.

Thank you for reading this article and keep researching :D.
