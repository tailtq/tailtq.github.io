# Notes

Before gathering data:

- Choose image size (critical)
- Choose expectation (percentage)
- Build dataset
    - Training set
    - Validation set
    - Test set
- Resize image temporarily
- Review dataset with small image size

# Probability

*(Give us a formal way of reasoning about the level of certainty)*

## Basic probability theory

**Natural approach to measure probability:** Take an individual times for a value and divide it by total number of times

**Law of large number:** Having more experimenting times, the probabilities will come closer and closer to the underlying probabilities

**Sampling:** Draw examples from probability distributions

**Multinomial distribution (Phân phối đa thức):** The distribution that assigns probabilities to a number of ***discrete choices***

## **Axioms of Probability Theory**

- **Sample space or outcome space:** Total results, samples or outcomes of a problem.

F.e: When rolling a dice, we have a sample space of $S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$

- **Event:** A set of outcomes from a given ***sample space.***

F.e: An event of getting an odd number when rolling a dice.

- The probability of an event A in the given sample space S is denoted as P(A), satisfies the following properties:
    - $P(A) ≥ 0$
    - $P(S) = 1$
    - For ***mutually exclusive*** events, the probability that any happens = sum of their individual probabilities

**Random variables (Biến ngẫu nhiên):**

Set X as a random variable, rather than specifying accurate like P(X = a), we can illustrate:

- $P(X)$ as the distribution over the random variable X
- $P(a)$ as a probability of a specific value

There is a difference between **discrete and continuous random variables**.

- Discrete RV: Numerical values
- Continuous RV: Infinite amount of values

F.e: Assume we calculate the probability of a person having height = 1.8m. If we take precise measurements, that height might be 1.80139278291028719, and no one else can have that height. So it is reasonable that we use **interval for calculating the probabilities**, like height of people falling between 1.7-1.8m

**2.6.2 Dealing with multiple Random Variables:**

> Very often, we will want to consider more than one random variable at a time. For instance, we may want to model the relationship between diseases and symptoms. Given a disease and a symptom, say “flu” and “cough”, either may or may not occur in a patient with some probability. While we hope that the probability of both would be close to zero, we may want to estimate these probabilities and their relationships to each other so that we may apply our inferences to effect better medical care.

> As a more complicated example, images contain millions of pixels, thus millions of random variables. And in many cases images will come with a label, identifying objects in the image. We can also think of the label as a random variable. We can even think of all the metadata as random variables such as location, time, aperture, focal length, ISO, focus distance, and camera type. All of these are random variables that occur jointly. When we deal with multiple random variables, there are several quantities of interest.

**Joint probability:** Two events have to happen simultaneously.

Notation: $$P(A = a, B = b) ~~or~~ P(A ∩ B)$$

Note: $$P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A), P(B)$$

**Conditional probability:** Probability of B = b, provided that A = a has occurred.

Notation and formula: $$P(B=b | A=a) = \frac{P(B = b, A = a)}{P(A = a)} = \frac{P(A ~∩~ B)}{P(A = a)}$$

**Bayes' Theorem:**

$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) . P(A)}{P(B)} (1)$$

To be more clear: Because $$P(A ∩ B) = P(B | A) . P(A) = P(A | B) . P(B)$$

**→ (1) is true**

**Marginalization (Phép biên hóa):**

Operation of determining $P(B)$ from $P(A, B)$. To be more theoretically:

Marginalisation is a method that requires summing over the possible values of one variable to determine the marginal contribution of another.

which is also known as ***sum rule***. The probability or distribution of marginalization is called a marginal probability or marginal distribution

Formulation: $$P(B) = AP(A, B)$$

**Independence:**

Two independent variables: The occurrence of an event A does not reveal any information of the occurrence of an event B

→ P(B | A) = P(B) → P(A, B) = P(A) * P(B)

Two events are independent only when the probability of their joint distribution is equal to the product of the individual probabilities

**2.6.3 Expectation and variance:**

Expectation and variance offer useful measures to summarize key characteristics of probability distributions

**Expectation (average) of random variable X:**

Formula: $$E[X] = xx P (X=x)$$

**Variance:**

Measure how much the random variable X deviates from its expectation

Formula: $$Var[X] = E [(X − E[X])2] = E[X2] − E[X]2$$

# Linear Algebra

## Vectors

### **Definition**

Vectors are 1-dimensional arrays of numbers or terms. In geometry, vectors store the **magnitude** and **direction** of a potential change to a point *(The vector [3, -2] says go right 3 and down 2)*

### **Notation**

$$v = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$
